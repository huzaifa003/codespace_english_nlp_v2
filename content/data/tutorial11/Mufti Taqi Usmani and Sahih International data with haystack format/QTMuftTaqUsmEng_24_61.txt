{'text': 'There is no blame on a blind person, nor is there any blame on any lame one, nor is there any blame on a sick person, nor on yourselves in that you eat (something) from your own homes or from the homes of your fathers or the homes of your mothers or the homes of your brothers or the homes of your sisters or the homes of your paternal uncles, or the homes of your paternal aunts or the homes of your maternal uncles or the homes of your maternal aunts or from the places the keys of which you have under your control,16 or from (the home of) your friend.There is no sin on you if you eat together or separately. So when you enter homes, greet one another with Salām , a greeting prescribed by Allah, which is blessed, pleasant. This is how Allah explains the verses to you, so that you may understand.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Mufti Taqi Usmani', 'surah_id': 24, 'ayah_no': 61, 'surah_name_en': 'An-Noor (The Light)', 'surah_name_ar': 'النور'}}
